            <h2>The Reason I Feel Sad</h2>

            <p>The reason I feel sad a lot of the time is that there is no great battle, no tremendous plight, or great expedition that is truly worth its weight in expenditure. Thereâ€™s no villain or antagonist to swing a sword at, vanquish, and we all go on to live happily ever after. It's this ubiquitous âœ¨nothingâœ¨ that encompasses all. 
			</p> <p> Everything can be remedied; or rather remedy is within our grasp â€” if only we would stoop to collect it.</p> </section>
<section> 
            <h1>The System Isnâ€™t Broken;<h1> 
			<h2>Itâ€™s Working Exactly As Itâ€™sÂ SupposedÂ To.</h2>Â

<h1>Homeless â€˜Crisisâ€™? â€” <h1> 
<h2>Thereâ€™s space; food and shelter a-plenty, 
and I defyÂ anyoneÂ that says otherwise.</h2> 

<p> 
Rather, to alleviate the problem would be to pose an alternative to the status-quo, weâ€™re all so dutifully ready to upholdâ€¦Â 

</p> <p>(Tell me, little lamb</p>

<p>Do you see destiny immutable?</p>

<p>Does fate or dedication</p>

<p>Keep you bended knee and dutiful?)</p>

<p><b>Think:</b> In simplicity, that shelter is to protect one from the weather: now, letâ€™s *ignore* the vacant hotels; apartments and houses that lay dormant to cement the fact;- that they are indeed aÂ commodity, unto themselves â€” much like money and weâ€™re all complicit little wage slaves in the capitalistic agenda *for a momentâ€¦Â 

</p> <p> But, itâ€™s plain as day to see, or rather â€˜planeâ€™ as I continueâ€¦ that a block of dis-used: cars, vans, caravans, aircraft, nautical vessel; hell, even corrugated steel â€” could secure a feasible â€˜lotâ€™ of accommodation; somewhere in the countryside.Â 

<p> With some simple amendments and appropriate conversionsâ€¦ A skip -Â with a roofâ€¦Â would probably pose more favourable conditions for those individuals that are relegated to the front of a shop, store or city centre bench; if it didnâ€™t forgo the convenience of location; in the act of â€˜begging.â€™

            <h2>Life is Just an Endless Series of Sub-routines...</h2>

            <p>Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance. We live in a society ðŸ¤¡ that is just convenient enough to sustain itself, while inconvenient, and â€˜un-justâ€™ enough to be questioned. 
			<hr><b>Identities are just varying levels of information. People are packets of data - projections that feign authenticity.</b></p>

            <p>There is no self</p> 
			<p>the fact that time is fleeting, and our short time on this earth is ultimately spent chasing arbitrary and trivial pursuits;</p><p> pains me terribly.<p>
			<p><b>'Expectation is the enemy of experience, and comparison the thief of joy.'</b></p> 
			<p>If you only exist relative to other peoples experience of you, you'll never amount to anything more than what they expect of you. And you wind up doing what you're told, not what you want.


But, what is the alternative to authority other than authenticity!?

If a man chooses and a slave obeys, is there any merit in choosing to obey? Is it any better to consciously conform to society, abide by convention if the net outcome is the same?
Â "Slaves dream not of freedom, but of becoming masters."



And what fuels that ambition? Money!ðŸ’¸

~ "money makes the world go round" ~Â 

Money has no intrinsic or inherent value, other than the one we give it as a society; and as individuals.

It promotes a false sense of productivity and has you chasing the next paycheck so you can buy another pointless commodity you'll come to take for granted "Whoever loves money never has enough" so the next time somebody says "think of the money" ask yourself, is this really what motivates me? Am I to be a wage slave in the face of endless and infinite, possibility in this universe?</p>

            <h2>The Shepherd, the Sheep, and the Abattoir.</h2>

            <p>We are the Shepherd, the Sheep, and the Abattoir. Slaughter approaches.</p>


<p> But, you canâ€™t spell Slaughter without Laughter - Ammirite? ðŸ™ƒðŸ¤™</p>

            <p>You know what really pisses me off about society? Yâ€™knowâ€¦ aside; from the fact that thereâ€™s no alternative options available ðŸ¥´- and, *wonâ€™t be* - at least in my lifetime or many, many, maannnyyyyy years to come.Â 

On account that: the restrictions, deprivation of liberties & freedoms imposed on us as individuals - and, as a species -Â 

stretch far beyond the barriers we perceive & the bars that we can see.Â 

(But, thatâ€™s a rant for another time..)



Itâ€™s not the juridical system, or the â€˜judicialâ€™ political parties that couldnâ€™t care lessÂ 



about those theyâ€™re supposed to serve the best interests of. And, it isnâ€™t even the â€˜Majority Rulesâ€™ system of whatâ€™s acceptable, and what **isnâ€™t** -Â 

that we currently have in place, where *Acceptable Action* is being lead, decided and dolled out by the Status Quo Parade; General Consensus that favours flavours of the week; or the most â€˜popularâ€™ unsubstantiated public opinion.Â 

Or, the figure-heads that feign to uphold this fallacy; crucifying any that deign to pose alternative thought - eliminating Autonomyâ€¦



No.Â 

Itâ€™s none of that.Â </p>

<p> Itâ€™s that a â€˜Machineâ€™, a â€˜Systemâ€™ or an â€˜Ideologyâ€™- does not care. Is not - and, will never be - capable of care. It is a *thing.*

That is what governs us, a cold, unflinching - remorseless - calculated Machine.

And what really kills me - is:

That *we* are the cogs that comprise this abhorrent Machine.Â 

We are collectively *this* - â€˜thingâ€™ {{motions to everything}} - We have the opportunity to actually be *greater* than the sum of our parts.</p> 
<p>Pool our efforts & abstractions - into something beautiful, something wonderful, worthy and something we can actually take pride in, culminate in something spectacular; that doesnâ€™t just label those who suffer within society as â€˜less fortunateâ€™ with a sanctimonious ring; and, moves right on throughâ€¦ But, no.Â 

We pay our dues into this perfunctory, belittling and unbefitting existence.Â </p>

<p> And, for what?</p> <p> Why? </p>

<h1> Deus Vult - Deus Ex Machina.<h1>

<h1>â€˜God Wills - God from the Machine.â€™</h1> 
<p>We are both: the Shepherds leading ourselves to our own demise.Â 

And, the sheep idly following the ridiculous ordained notion of what â€˜should beâ€™Â 

^That we have burdened ourselves with.Â 

That expectation, that directionless ambition - that whirring, grinding existence.Â 

Wasting our time; and for what?Â 
To what motion?Â Â why are we fucking doing this?Â </p>Â 
<p> To what end?! </p>



<p> And then, by that effect -Â 

we are the abattoir too,

consumed by time.Â </p>

    <h2>Now what?</h2>



    <p>Now what? Live on a mountain, or island â€” and deprive myself of the convenience; presently at hand? â€˜Run for politicsâ€™, and substantiate the opinion I already hold; that people are wholly inane, and vacant â€” hateful things? Learn any â€˜assortmentâ€™ of feasibly transferable, lucrative skill and suitable acclimation? Facilitate a financially lucrative backdrop â€” What?? What is it weâ€™re supposed to be doing here? â€œLife has no intrinsic worth, but is kept in motion merely by desire and illusion." Arthur Schopenhauer.</p>
